MEETUP DO NUBANK REALIZADO EM 22-02-2022

DESCRIPTION: 
Nick Huntington-Klein vai falar sobre como identificar uma relação de causalidade, e como não confundir causalidade com correlação; 
e Sean Taylor vai nos trazer a relação da teoria com experimentos para estimar os efeitos causais.

--------------------

WHAT QUESTION - Many parts of DS and ml are focused to answering WHAT questions, looking for patterns present in data.

WHY QUESTIONS - why questions are important because they dont just tell us what is in data, they tell us about ckunterfactuals and causality
    why do sales tend to increase right after we advertise more?
    why has our site traffic been declined?

Often patterns in data do not answer WHY questions

We cant just get a what and expect it to tell us a why - correlation is not causation

Identification is the process to figure out which correlations are causal

Test A/B is a type of identification experiment

Adjust for seasonality is a form of identification - eg. in december we have more sales due to seasonality and remove this effect

How identify if my waht is answering why:
    when see a pattern at data, ask why that pattern might be there
    trick part, find a part of the data where those alternate explanations dont apply (like in a experiment)

So, do not rely only in data, we have to think about the source of the data (data generation process - DGP)

Maping out DGP is just to ask: what variables are likely to be relevant  in causing my variables of interest

Example of Causal Diagram to map out DGP --> Sales (why my recents sales raised?) --> month of year, ads, product launch, recent sales

Making Reasonable Assumptions
    The models will be always incomplete, ask if it is too wrong to use
    Ask others about variables that can impact
